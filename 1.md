---

# **# C PROGRAMMING QUIZ & ANSWER BANK**

### *Covers Unit-II & Unit-III (Data Types → Functions → Arrays → Recursion → Errors)*

---

---

# ## **SECTION 1 — THEORY QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS**

---

### **1. What is the difference between variable declaration and definition?**

* **Declaration:** Introduces variable name and type (no memory allocated).
* **Definition:** Allocates memory to variable.

> In C, declaration = definition unless `extern` is used.

---

### **2. What are keywords? Give examples.**

Reserved words with predefined meaning.
Examples: `int`, `char`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `return`.

---

### **3. List four data types in C.**

`int`, `char`, `float`, `double`.

---

### **4. What is the use of sizeof operator?**

Returns number of bytes used by a data type/variable.

---

### **5. Explain operator precedence.**

Defines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.

---

### **6. What is recursion?**

A function calling itself.

---

### **7. What is an array?**

A collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory.

---

### **8. What is a multidimensional array?**

Array containing other arrays. Example:

```c
int matrix[3][3];
```

---

### **9. What is pass-by-value?**

Function receives a **copy** of the argument. Changes do not affect original variable.

---

### **10. What is pass-by-reference?**

Function receives the **address** of the variable. Changes affect the original variable.

---

---

# ## **SECTION 2 — MEDIUM QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS**

---

### **11. Types of logical operators in C**

* `&&` → Logical AND
* `||` → Logical OR
* `!`  → Logical NOT

---

### **12. Difference between while and do-while**

| while                   | do-while                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Condition checked first | Body executes at least once |
| May run zero times      | Runs at least once          |

---

### **13. Syntax of switch-case**

```c
switch(expression) {
    case 1: statements; break;
    case 2: statements; break;
    default: statements;
}
```

---

### **14. Use of break and continue**

* `break` → exits loop/switch
* `continue` → skips current iteration

---

### **15. Structure of a C program**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // declarations
    // statements
    return 0;
}
```

---

---

### **4. Which loop executes at least once?**

a) for
b) while
c) do-while
d) none

---

### **5. What is the index of first array element?**
